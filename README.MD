## Project Description
Picky-Eater is a web and mobile app that allows users to search nutrional value of the food they eat, search for healthy recipies, and collect previously searched recipes for future use.  The app was built with HTML, CSS, Embedded JavaScript, and Node.js following responsive design principles. We used a RESTful API from FatSecrets to call on data.
