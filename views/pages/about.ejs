                  <p>After serving 6 years in the military as Persian Farsi linguist and Intelligence analyst, I decided to apply those language learning and logic skills to a career in coding. At the beginning of April I dropped everything and moved across the country to puruse that goal. I hope you enjoy our first independent project after completing Code Fellows 301.</p>
